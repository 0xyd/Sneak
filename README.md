# OnionCurl
OnionCurl is a URL transfer tool based on Tor technology.

## Features
1. Dynamic ip addresses
2. Multiprocess
3. Fast 

## Dependencies
OnionCurl hides itself through the tor so make sure the machines you are using are able to work with it.

To use Tor's powerful techniques, we have to install stem, a python API of Tor.
```
    pip install stem
```

We want to make OnionCurl more efficient and scalable, we choose pycurl rather than requests.
```
    pip install pycurl
```


## Installation

[WARNING] We are currently on Testing, feel free to report any ideas and bugs.
