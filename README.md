# Stealther
Stealther is a ninja traveling between dark and light. 
It hides itself in the tor network and make others feel creepy...

## Function
Stealther is currently made as a crawler hiding its identity.

## Dependencies
Stealther hides itself through the tor so make sure the machines you are using are able to work with it.

To use Tor's powerful techniques, we have to install stem, a python API of Tor.
```
    pip install stem
```

We want to make Stealther more efficient and scalable, we choose pycurl rather than requests.
```
    pip install pycurl
```


## Installation

[WARNING] We are currently on Testing, feel free to report any ideas and bugs.

## API
class Spider
